#Author Dukes: Date 10/08/2021: Purpose: Creating a simple linear regression model

#Relationship we want to generate/test is if happiness is more with more facebook usage or if its vice-versa
x <- c(151, 174, 138, 186, 128, 136, 179, 163, 152, 131)

#y is a dependent variable/outcome/ Happiness ranked on scale 0-10 
y <- c(1, 2, 9, 3, 4, 5, 7, 2, 2, 8)

relation <- lm(y~x)

print(relation)
